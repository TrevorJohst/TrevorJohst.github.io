    <h5 id="overview">Overview</h5>
    <p>
    Throughout the beginning of the class we were introduced to various design topics and worked on smaller projects to learn about different tools (bandsaw, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc). Once all tools were introduced, we began working towards our final project. We came up with as many ideas as possible in our initial brainstorming. It was then narrowed down to three ideas, which we developed further and produced poster boards for. Of those, we picked two to develop into prototypes. Finally, we decided on Tumble Tower for our final toy and built the final product.
    </p>
    
    <h5 id="early">Early Projects</h5>
    <p>
    One of the first projects we worked on in class was a Simon Says game we referred to as a Toober. This project was meant to introduce us to CAD and 3D printing. We were given a blank model of a box that the parts would fit into, and were tasked with decorating it however we saw fit. Our models were then printed on an FDM printer for us to assemble/wire. My final Toober was based on the JPL Curiosity rover. Another shorter project that was worked on was a push toy. We sketched out a design for the toy that we could then cut out on the bandsaws. We also used the drill press, so wheels could be inserted.

    <p>
    The final toy went through many stages of design before we settled on what was produced. Very early ideas were simply written down and pitched to the rest of the team. Eventually we produced sketches of the ideas we found most promising. One of my early ideas called Wobble Tower eventually evolved into Tumble Tower. The main addition from the initial pitch was a vibrating platform that the game takes place on. The next step in the process was to develop a poster board for three of our ideas. We presented these to the class for feedback. From these three we selected Tumble Tower and Build-a-Bridge to develop into prototypes. We then took these prototypes to a museum where we had children play with them and give us feedback on what they did and didn't like.

    Finally, we developed a list of parts we would need to produce the final product, ordered them, and got building. The baseplate was made by bending a piece of sheet metal and attaching it to two wooden sides. A stepper motor was used to move a custom plate back and forth, which was controlled by an Arduino. The vibrating blocks were 3D printed to house vibration motors, a battery, and a button switch. Magnetic blocks were drilled out, and disc magnets were glued into place. Slippery and rough blocks were created using Teflon and sandpaper respectively.

    The class ended with every team presenting their toys to the greater MIT community on Killian Court. The full webcast can be found below, we were team pig.
